Unattended setup for Windows 2000 and XP.

For unattended setup use system tools like sysprep and sysdiff and winnt32.
This tools are provided by Microsoft.
Additionally for those, that like only to preinstall drivers, we provide the tool
vsust. To use this tool copy the installation directory from CD or floppy to your hard drive
and execute vsust <your directory>. Shutdown the system, plug in the card and start the system.
The Pnp installation can be finished only by pressing continue.
